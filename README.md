Plugins for the VCV soft-synth.

These are based on some Atmel-based physical modules I made a number of years ago.  The software versions here replicate that crunchy 8-bit aliased sound of the originals, but use floats instead of integer math and bit shifts.  Hopefully the hilarious backwards-ness of this amuses you as much as it amused me.

phaseCzar is inspired by Casio's phase distortion method. 

pulseCzar is ispired by Curtis Roads' pulsar synthesis.
